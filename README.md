# Automating a blog which several people can contribute to

This is an experimental website for a local climate action group. It is also to some 
extent driving my contributions to the [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/) framework,
because in building it I'm finding quirks in Cryogen which I'm fixing as I go.

But really, unless you're also using Cryogen for collaborative projects, or you're 
local to Auchencairn village (in which case you'll find this content much easier to
read at [act.scot](https://act.scot), this isn't really of much interest to you.
