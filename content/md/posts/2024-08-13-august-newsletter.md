## Carrifran Wildwood Minibus Trip

Auchencairn Community Transport project were delighted to welcome ten
members of the community on our inaugural minibus trip to Carrifran Wildwood
on 4th August. Carrifran is an inspiring landscape rewilding project managed by
the Borders Forest Trust. Accompanied by nature guide Barry O’Dowd,
participants enjoyed a beautiful walk through the valley, the best example of
ecologically planned woodland creation in the UK. Special highlights were
sightings of a Golden Eagle, a family of Peregrine falcons and a Scotch Argus
butterfly. Many thanks also to Susanna who was our ACT rep for the day.
Over the coming months ACT will be running more excursions and shopping
trips (see page 3 for upcoming trips). Our minibus trips are for everyone and we
welcome suggestions on what trips you’d like to see and how they can serve the
needs of our community.
